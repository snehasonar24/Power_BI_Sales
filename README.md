**4. Steps to Build This Dashboard**

Step 1: Data Collection
Ensure that the dataset contains columns such as Transaction ID, Revenue, Date, Store ID, Product ID, Sales Rep ID, Country, Region, Gender, and Year.

Clean and transform the dataset, removing duplicates and handling missing values.

Step 2: Import Data into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop and import your dataset using the "Get Data" option.

Choose your data source (e.g., Excel, SQL Server, CSV) and load the data into Power BI.


Step 3: Data Modeling
Establish relationships between the tables if the data is in a star schema or snowflake schema.

Example relationships:

Sales → Stores (based on Store ID)

Sales → Products (based on Product ID)

Sales → Regions (based on Country/Region mapping)

Ensure correct data types are assigned to each column (e.g., date, currency, text).

Step 4: Create Calculated Columns and Measures

Total Transaction: Count of unique Transaction IDs.

Formula: Total Transaction = COUNT('Sales'[Transaction ID])

Average Revenue: Average of revenue for the dataset.

Formula: Average Revenue = AVERAGE('Sales'[Revenue])

Total Revenue: Sum of the revenue for the dataset.

Formula: Total Revenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])

Step 5: Visualizations

Total Transaction, Average Revenue, Total Revenue (Cards):

Add card visuals and apply the corresponding measures to display the metrics.

Total Revenue and Average Revenue by Country:

Use a Clustered Bar Chart for total revenue and overlay it with a Line Chart for average revenue.

Axis: Country

Total Revenue by Store:

Insert a Treemap visual and drag Store to the group field and Revenue to the values field.

Total Revenue by Region:

Use a Donut Chart. Add Region to the legend and Revenue to values.

Total Revenue by Products and Rank:

Insert an Area Chart for the products' performance, grouped by rank (Store).

Total Revenue by Quarter:

Use a Line Chart with Quarter on the axis and Revenue as the values.

Total Revenue and Average Revenue by Month:

Insert a Combined Bar and Line Chart visual with months as the axis and both total and average revenue as values.

Sales Reps Performance Table:

Add a Table Visual with columns for Sales Rep names, total revenue, and average revenue.


Step 6: Add Filters and Slicers

Add slicers for Year, Store Rank, and Gender for interactivity.

Ensure each visual is interacting properly by managing the edit interactions feature.

**5. Report Conclusion**

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales data, with breakdowns by country, store, product, and salesperson. It allows decision-makers to track performance across various dimensions and time periods. The interactivity of the dashboard, driven by slicers and filters, helps users gain deeper insights into sales performance.
